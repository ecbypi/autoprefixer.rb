# autoprefixer.rb

Exploration into implementing `autoprefixer` in ruby.

Since `autoprefixer-rails` [has been deprecated], and the author [explained the
ruby-to-JS bridge] was the source of difficulty, I thought reimplementing it in
ruby might be a work-around in order to continue using `sprockets`.
